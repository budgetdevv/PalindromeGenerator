**High-performance palindrome sequence generator.**

# Why?
Mainly made it to check my Python assignment. It also helps in deepening my understanding of palindromes.

# Features
• Low-memory footprint and minimal GC allocations
• Good runtime performance
• Supports generation of character-unit and word-unit ( WIP ) palindromes.
• Different edge cases are generated. E.x. Single whitespace ( Alpha-numerical and vice-versa ), odd / even sequences ( With and without non-alphanumerical characters ).
